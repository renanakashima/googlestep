Question 2:
The complexity of searching / adding / removing an element is mostly O(1) with a hash table, whereas the complexity is O(log N) with a tree. This means that a hash table is more efficient than a tree. However, real-world large-scale database systems tend to prefer a tree to a hash table. Why? List as many reasons as possible.

- Knowing the right table size 
- Cost of re-hashing
- The worst case of hash table is O(N): trees guarantee O(logN)

Question 3:
- Linked List
